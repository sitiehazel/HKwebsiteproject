        <h1>Unit 1 Outcome 2</h1>
 
        <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
 <div> 
    
<div>
    <p>
    
    
        Trello helped me  to plan and organise the project. I was able to track the progress of the project and email notifications from Trello reminded me of deadlines when I was not using trail. I used visual studio code to code  and design the website using languages like HTML and CSS. I also used google for other resources such as google fonts which were part of the coding of the website. 
    
    
    </p>
        </div>

    <div>
    <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
</div>


    <div>
    <p>
        As stated previously visual studio code was the platform used  for coding and designing of the website by incorporating open-end programmes such as HTML and CSS. Trello was the tool used to organise and track the progress of the project. Google was used to research questions which were part of the project. However as an individual new to coding I felt that I needed more time to understand the languages such as html and css better and that would have allowed me to optimise their use efficiently.

    <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
</div>
   
    <div>
    <p>
    
        If I had more time to design  the website I would have ensured that my website was complex (fancy features) simultaneously retaining user friendly capability. I would have loved to experiment and play around with other features like adding GIFs and animations to make my website exciting and attract more users. I  would also have conducted more research on website design to borrow some  ideas from other website. 
    </p>
    
    </div>
    
    <div>
    <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
</div>
   
    <div>
    <p>
        As stated earlier, I would have loved more time to design the website to have more colours and buttons, images, videos and animations. Just to experience with more ideas and codes to come up with the the best design., better layout, best possible colour combination, use of flexbox.

<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
</div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The project requirement was to answer some questions and to create a website using frontend languages  such as HTML and CSS. To answer some of the questions we had to do our own research using google search engine and we were required to provide reference links of the websites we used to obtained information used to answer the questions. The other part of the project was basically to review what we had done and what IT tools were used and also to write  a brief personal profile  in the about me page. Some of the IT tools I used were Trello for planning, slack for viewing course resources and requesting further assistance from the trainer if required, html and css for coding and designing the website to ensure that it was running smoothly with no code glitches.
