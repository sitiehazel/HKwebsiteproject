        <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
 <div> 
    
<div>
    <p>
    
    
        Trello helped me  to plan and organise the project. I was able to track the progress of the project and email notifications from Trello reminded of deadlines when I was mot using trail. 
    
        I used visual studio code to code  and design the website using languages like HTML and CSS. 
        
        I also used google for other resources such as google fonts which were part of the coding of the website. 
    
    
    </p>
        </div>

    <div>
    <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
</div>


    <div>
    <p>
        As stated previously Visual studio code assisted in coding and designing of the website by using open-end programmes such as HTML and CSS. 
    
        Trello was the tool used to organise and track the progress of the project. Google was used to research questions which were part of the project.

    </div>
    <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
</div>
   
    <div>
    <p>
    
        Right now as I am writing I am not happy with my website because I have not been able to use flexbox in CSS to fully design my website. I am struggling to understand the language itself and how to code it properly. 
    
        If I had more. time to design and  the website I would have added more buttons and I have researched more on website design to borrow some  ideas from other website. I would have loved to make more user friendly. 
    </p>

    <div>
    <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
</div>
   
    <div>
    <p>
        As stated earlier, I would have loved more time to design the website to have more colours and buttons and pictures. Just experience with more ideas and codes to come up with the the best design. The state of my website at the moment is not very appealing hence the wish to have more time to understand how CSS works and how I can customise the programme to my own preference .
