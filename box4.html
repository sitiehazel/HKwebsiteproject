<h1>Unit 1 Outcome 3 (Reviewing)</h1>
 
    <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
   
</div>

    <div>

    <p>
        First and foremost to be more efficient and productive you to have an understanding of how the tools and systems work. As a  coding novice most of time was wasted trying to figure out how the code works. Copying and pasting does work but when you encounter a problem you don’t know why the problem occurred and how to resolve the issue. From my perception I can confidently say that I wasted more time in trying to understand how CSS flexbox work. I was given the resources in the lesson but I still struggled to understand on my own and I think I will keep on learning I still I fully understand. 
        I trust that if I was pat of the team I would have been more efficient  and productive considering that the work would have  been divided amongst my team and any issues that I faced on my own I would have consulted my team for assistance and I would have learned how to properly use flexbox. Just like with Python project when I struggled with the code I learned to understand the code from my team.

<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
</div>

<div>
 <p>
        I improved productivity and efficiency by taking regular breaks during the project that helped to stay focused. 

I was also being realistic by doing the project bit by bit to ensure that I was overwhelmed. Basically I would 2 questions at a time thus I divided the project into small achievable tasks.

If I was part of a team I guess the best way would be effective communication  through feedback so that everyone in the team is aware of the progress of the project and the goals.

Training is another way to improve efficiency and productivity. competent employees don’t waste time trying to figure out what to do but they get on with the task at hand. 

Incentives can be a motivator to improve productivity, for instance lets say if we finish a certain task by Friday in the morning then we can finish work at 3pm instead of 5pm and get paid for a full day. Trust me I will make sure that I have finished my targets by Friday morning and 3pm on the dot I am ready to go its Friday after all. 

Team work is also important, sharing of  ideas, division of tasks and all the benefits that comes with team work. 

Trello is a good example for a team to use to plan and organise, if used appropriately it can help to improve efficiency and productivity.

<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        Team work would definitely assist me to work efficiently especially since I am new to coding hence I am rely on my team to help me where I am struggling. 

Slack as a tool for instant communication is also good if working as a team, its best for shot term planning and you can easily post questions or feedback to your team when online and they can give you answers on the spot unlike email. 

In the future I would spend more Tim training to understand more how the code works and  the actual language behind the code. I believe that once I understand and not memorise I would be able to design my website as I visualise.

<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>

</div>

<div>
    <p>
        If I was working as part of a team I would send my code to a my team to try and see if it works on their computer and any issued to be reported back for solutions.
