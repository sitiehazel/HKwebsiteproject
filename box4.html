<h1>Unit 1 Outcome 3 (Reviewing)</h1>
 
    <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
   
</div>

    <div>

    <p>
        First and foremost to be more efficient and productive you have to have an understanding of how the tools and systems work. As a  coding novice a substantial  amount of time was wasted in trying to figure out how the code works. Copying and pasting does work but when you encounter a problem you don’t know why the problem occurred and how to resolve the issue. From my perception I can confidently say that I wasted more time in trying to understand how CSS flexbox work, but on the other hand I managed to learn the basic idea behind te languange. Also the learning resources provided through slack and the zoom lessons helped me understand html and css and to design my website and I will keep on learning more through my own research. I believe that if I was part of a team I would have been more efficient  and productive considering that the work would have  been divided amongst my team and any issues that I faced on my own I would have consulted my team for assistance and I would have learned  optimise flexbox usage.

<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
</div>

<div>
 <p>
    There are various ways productivity can be improved whether working on your own or as part of a team. As an individual, through my own initiative I improved productivity and efficiency by taking regular breaks during the project  and that helped to stay focused. I also set up  realistic and achievable goals and targets  to ensure that I was not overwhelmed with the workload. I was in control of my own time thus I was working when I was more efficient and productive. On the contrary  effective team work does improve productivity and  efficiency through effective communication by constant feedback  and ensuring all team members are aware of the progress of the project.Training is another way to improve efficiency and productivity, competent employees don't waste time fiddling they are more likely to get on with the job as they know what they are doing.  Incentives can be a motivator to improve productivity, for instance lets say if we finish a certain task by Friday in the morning then we can finish work at 3pm instead of 5pm and get paid for a full day. Trust me I will make sure that I have finished my targets by Friday morning and 3pm on the dot I am ready to go its Friday after all.

<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        Team work would definitely assist me to work efficiently especially since I am new to coding therefore sharing knowledge through brainstorming with my team would help me to resolve issues that I may face with my code. 
Slack as a tool for instant communication is also good for team work. it can be  optimised for short term planning as you can easily post questions or feedback to your team when they are  online and they are able to give you answers instantly. In future I would invest more time training and research to  get a better understanding of programmes such as flexbox.

<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>

</div>

<div>
    <p>
        Being part of a team would have made it easier for me to test my website project. Other people can easily spot your mistakes whereas you have overlooked them. Since I was doing the project on my own  I used online platforms such as google and chrome to see if the   code was running smoothly thus if my website was operating smoothly with zero glitches.
