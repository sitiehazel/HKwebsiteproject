    <h2>1.5 Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
    If the content you plan to publish on your website was not originally created by yourself then you have to ensure that you have obtain authorisation from the the original creator of the content. Without prior authorisation then you are risking copyright infringement which can result in persecution by the law. As a website designer you are basically limited to what content you can display on your website. 
     In the UK you do not have to register your original creations, if I am a website designer and I think I have come up with an original idea and because there is no register to go and check if my idea is original then I risk a criminal offence if it turns out that my idea is not actually original and there is already a website displaying the same content. But how was I to know that there is website already created with the content, I googled prior to my creations but nothing came up. 
    <br>
    <br>
     On the other hand copyright in the UK is good since you don’t have to register in the UK for copyright as you are automatically covered by the law once you have published your original content. However your work is vulnerable on the internet as anyone can steal your idea and it is your job to prove that you are the original creator if you plan to sue the perpetrator.  And also if the person is on the other side of the continent for instance Brazil does the UK law protect you? How do you plan to sue this Brazilian citizen?

    <h2>1.6 Describe access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>

</div>
<div>  
<p>
Visually impaired people with conditions such as blindness, vision loss, and colour blindness are not able to view the web pages as people without visual impairments. For instance blind people  are not able to access the web suing the standard display or printed output. However they rely on screen reader software to read  out the web content of the visited site, or they may use refreshable braille displays a devise which displays the web content in braille.  Because they can’t see graphics it is crucial that web designers include text alternatives to make graphical features or images accessible. Whilst web users with vision mosslike lazy eyes etc, they use equipment such as large monitors and anti-glare screens or screen enlarge software etc to make the screen or webpage adaptable to their needs . 
<br>
<br>

People with physical disabilities such as no hands or arthritis  etc may not be able yo use the keyboard of a computer. They may need of adaptive technology to access the web. 
<br>
<br>

Deaf or Hard Hearing People are not able to hear the audio files on web browsers.  They may use a flash to replace a computer tone or prompt.
<br>
<br>


People with learning disabilities may appear  to be okay in terms of they have no physical disability  and they have no visual impairment and often maybe overlooked. However  they may need adaptive equipment which maybe used to help them read write and organise themselves depending on the level of learning difficulties.

<h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>

</div>

<div>
<p>
Choosing the correct file type for your website is very important in order to prevent issues such as broken images and the wrong file format can affect website speed.
<br>
<br>

JPEG is a raster file type which can contain up to 16 million  different colours. JPEG is the populars choice for saving photos due to their flexibility of shrinking the image size and it does not affect the speed of the website . However the drawback is that JPEG  uses lossy compression which results in loosing the format and quality graphics, logos  and text and it does not support transparent background. 
<br>
<br>

PNG is raster file that’s uses lossless compression thus it retains the file information and quality when saved. There are 2 types of PNGs which are PNG-8 that contains up to 256 different colours and PNG-24 that can contain unlimited amount of colours. Because it uses lossless compression PNG is good for images, graphics, text,  logos and it also supports transparent backgrounds. However PNG is not supported on all webpages as result not all users can view your site if browser cannot support PNG.
<br>
<br>

GIF is a raster file type and the file sizes are smaller. GIFs are best for small graphics and logos and suitable for placing small logos and buttons on a website.  They can also be used for text and transparent backgrounds and they can be animated. Because GIFs aren’t capable of handling millions of colours the drawback is that they are not suitable for images and photos with a lot of colour and shading.
<br>
<br>

SVGs do not use pixels but they are built using mathematical formulas hence they are vector based. They are best for creating full resolution images, graphics, logos and animations. SVGs can be viewed on all devices and they don’t affect the speed of the webpage. 
<br>
<br>

PDF (portable document format) is suitable for fix format document sharing. It contains fonts, images layout and paper size which  are useful for rendering a document. 
<br>
<br>

HTML is  a language and format used for webpages.  Because the files are text based the user can view html files in plain text editor. HTML is supported by most languages and applications because it is used in every website. 
<br>
<br>

WAV is an audio file that is lossless and most used for raw sound samples and short in app sound effects. 
<br>
<br>

MP3 is another audio file that is  mostly used in portable music files.  it uses lossy compression which affects the quality of the sound. However because of the type of the equipment used to play the mp3 files the low sound quality is not notable. 
<br>
<br>

FLV is a  flash video format for streaming videos online. The user is required to use a plugin to stream the video using Adobe flash player. Until recently it was used on web platforms such as YouTube however it has recently been replaced by WEBM and other HTML5 video formats  that don’t require the use of plugins to stream online videos. 
<br>
<br>

WEBM is a relatively new  open video format used on sites such as YouTube to stream short videos. Developed by google to fill the void not supported by other file formats and it is proving to be popular.
