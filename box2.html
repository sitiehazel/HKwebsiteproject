    <h2>1.1 Describe the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
</div>

<div>
<p>
    
 In the modern world technology plays a crucial role in giving  businesses a competitive edge. Online platforms allow businesses to sale their merchandise 24/7 even when the physical shops are closed for consumers. Recently we have witnessed that companies without websites were not able to sale their products during the lockdown, as a result their profit margins were affected.
IT fosters innovation in businesses which leads to efficiency in running businesses. Through innovation businesses benefit from smatter applications, improved data storage and wider information distribution. IT innovations has created a platform for online shopping, social networking, the use of cookies to monitor user online shopping habits and user information is collected virtually for marketing purposes. For instance, if you visit a website selling fashion shoes  the next adverts  trailing in  your browser will be about shoes and other related products.[1]

<h2>1.2 Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
</div>

<div>

<p>

    A wide range of skills and tools are required to guarantee the success of a project. We have to select a competent project leader with relevant skills who should showcase great leadership skills in order to manage a team and a project successfully. For instance websites like slack gives a team to vote anonymously for someone they think has the ability to lead the team successfully. [2]
    Then we have to ensure that we are working as a team not as individuals to avoid producing a disjointed and probably unsuccessful project. Our ability to plan and organise ourselves as a team  is also essential because failure to plan and  a disorganised team may not lead to the intended outcome of the project, we can use websites like Trello and the use of KANBAN for planning and organising . [2]


    Creativity is also a key element in ensuring a successful project, great ideas may help us to produce a very interesting project which may attract more users than anticipated. These days with the internet there are many websites you can get inspiration from. Let’s be honest most of the creative ideas are borrowed ideas which have been improved to a certain level. So as a team we can use those resources to get inspiration. 
    [2]

    Project knowledge is crucial because if no one in the team does not know how to executive the project itself then no amount of planning and organising will lead to the project being successful. For example if the team  is planning to design a website,  we can plan and organise ourselves  however if we don’t know python code or HTML language or CSS programme, or  we don’t have  the right hardware or file types to use in order to design a website  then our project is a failure.

<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h2>
</div>

<div>

<p>
    In order to plan designing a website first and foremost I need to know what is the purpose of my website and what content am I going to display on the website? If the website is about me what information about myself am I planning to share. I will use Trello to plan and organise myself[3] [4]

    Who exactly is my target audience this  will determine how I will design my website  for instance is it for professionals or young people?  Once I answer this question then I will decide how my website will look like. I will use KANBAN. [3][4]


    Visualising how I am going to design my website to ensure that it is user friendly at the same time it attracts my target audience.  using python as a backend programme and also programmes such as html and css which are frontend programmes. I will consider the file types I am planning to use on the website if they are accessible by all users. [4]
 Trello and KANBAN will  help me to plan and organise myself and put my ideas in order and track the progress of my project.<a href="https://trello.com/b/BLvl3cfP/website-project"> Trello</a>.

<h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
</div>

<div>
<p>

Failure to properly research your project can lead to unsuccessful outcome. You need to dedicate more time into researching and planning.If you fail to work as a team that is another issue that can lead to project failure. For a big project team work is crucial to ensure that you are all on the same level and working towards the same goal. If you fail to do so and you work as individuals in a team you may end up with a disjointed project in the end because each person had a different view of the intended outcome. [5][6]


Lack of combination of skill set thus if you only include people with digital skills without incorporating people with for instance marketing skills or people skills you may fail to bringing into the project a different perspective from non digital oriented people which may have helped to make a project a success.[5][6]

Cyber attacks can also hinder the success of your project, we hear these days of companies being held hostage by hackers who request millions  of  cash money to release your information, however there is no guarantee that the hackers may not steal the company’s projects even after the ransom has been paid. We have also heard of hackers who steal information of a company’s customers putting both the company and consumers at financial risk and data breaching (GDPR) which may result in financial losses.[5][6]

<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
</div>

<div>

<p>
Selecting the systems and software will be part of the research and planning. once we have established what our goals are then we will decide what the right systems will be. 

Budget is also fundamental in choosing the type of technology we are going to use. If we have a low budget we are not going to buy a MacBook when a pc at half the price can do the same job. In terms of software there  are other cheap alternatives on the market which we can also produce the same results. However if our project requires high end products which deliver better and efficient performance compared to the cheap alternatives,  then what do we do if we have a limited budget? Then again research and planning will prove fundamental here. 

Factors like user friendly technology will also be ideal for someone who is new to technology.  You are not going to buy complicated software for advanced users when your team consists of amateurs only. Then again what costs more, complicated or user friendly? if the complicated costs less then we are doomed as a team because we will have to invest more time learning the  new technology.

<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
</div>

<div>
<p>
Before precessing any personal data in digital project for instance marketing  you will have to ensure you have obtained the right consent from each and every individual in the marketing campaign. Failure to do so may result in legal persecution because you are breaking the law, which can be costly to a business if found guilty because of financial penalties. 

To obtain consent from every individual you are trying to involve in your marketing project for instance may take time which can result in project delays. The total number of responses you might get from the targeted audience may be lower than expected probably people not willing to receive junk marketing email from companies that may affect the overall outcome of your project. for instance if you were carrying out a survey to see how many   would be interested in your new noodle soup.

    <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan</h2>
</div>
<br>
<br>

<div>
    <p>
        Trello has helped me to plan my website project and organise myself. I can easily keep track of my progress and I know  what needs to be done by when and what needs to be prioritised. Being organised has really helped as I am in control of every aspect of the project and I am not panicking.
Google search engine has helped me in my research to answer some of the key questions hence assisting me in achieving my trello planned targets within planned time.
